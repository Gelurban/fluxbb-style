#Laravel FluxBB Style

Just drop **Laravel.css** and **Laravel/** into the **style/** directory of your FluxBB install and select the **Laravel** style in your profile.

##Notes

This style is designed for use on the [laravel.com forums](http://forums.laravel.com/) and is shared so the community to help maintain everything.  Many things are hard-coded for Laravel's use including the *Google Analytics* tracking code.  If you do use this elsewhere please remove the Laravel specifics 
before going live.
